            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Discovering Contemporary Dance. </h1><h2>“ Do you think in order to understand movement, you have to have moved yourself?”</h2><p>Every journey must start somewhere, mine started on October 7th, I was preoccupied with a burning question. My goal was to seek out a better understanding of the contemporary dance world, a world that I wanted to be a part of but had little practical experience of. A result of the past year or so has been the desire to attempt to design with a sense of ‘truth’. In the most basic of forms I suppose that to me, the truth of lighting dance would be to have an affinity to the movement. But must I be able to move in order to portray the true intent of movement? This was the genesis of my exploration, I set about planning forwards, those I would want to meet, questions I must ask.</p></article>]]></description>
